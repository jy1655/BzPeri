BzPeri Modernization (2025):
  - Updated for BlueZ 5.77+ compatibility
  - C++20 modernization with std::expected error handling
  - Enhanced D-Bus integration replacing HCI Management API
  - Improved connection stability and bondable configuration
  - Performance optimizations for modern Linux systems

This software contains code derived from Gobbledegook. We extend our sincere
gratitude to Paul Nettle for creating the original foundation that made this
modern Bluetooth LE library possible.

Key architectural improvements while preserving the original design philosophy:
  - Maintained the elegant DSL-style service definition
  - Preserved the thread-safe data callback architecture
  - Enhanced the server initialization and error handling
  - Modernized the BlueZ adapter management

Both the original Gobbledegook and BzPeri are committed to providing developers
with powerful, easy-to-use Bluetooth LE GATT server capabilities for Linux systems.
